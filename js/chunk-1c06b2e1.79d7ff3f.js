Water Rangers is a Canadian not-for-profit organization that promotes and supports citizen science water testing around the world. Water Rangers is a non-profit organization that promotes citizen science water quality testing to fill gaps in the data collected on water bodies worldwide (with a focus in Canada). Filling data gaps in waterbodies worldwide requires a large user base so increasing user traffic and increasing user retention to their website is integral to building a large user base. They have developed an online open data platform web app that allows citizen scientists who are registered with their organization (referred to as “Water Rangers”) to upload their water testing data. "),Object(s["g"])("p",null," To support their initiative they have developed an online data platform where site users (called Water Rangers) can upload their water quality testing data (metrics such as temperature, pH, alkalinity and more). The data platform has a main Map page where all the locations where water testing observations have been taken show up as points on the map. It also has a Locations page which has “cards” for each location where Water Rangers have tested and uploaded their data, an Observations page which has “cards” for each individual set of data points that have been uploaded, an Issues page which has “cards” for water quality issues that Water Rangers have reported (e.g. pollution, algae blooms, etc.) and a Groups page which has cards for different local groups of people that test in a specific area or body of water.

Personas are used to build empathy between the designer and the user so that the designer can address the user’s issues more effectively. Next, I used the personas to make user journey maps and identify possible pain points for first-time or new users. I also analyzed the web analytics data that was collected on Google Analytics for the data platform to identify issues in key metrics used in web applications and websites (e.g. bounce rate, user visit length, number of users, pages visited etc.) to build a better picture of where users were running into issues. For example, the data platform had a bounce rate of ~66% which is over 6% higher than the average range of 40-60%. This indicated that a large number of the users coming to the website were leaving immediately which gave me insight into their user journey and where the pain points were. Once the user journey map was completed and I identified user pain points, I designed changes to the platform to mitigate the issues. Over the course of the term, the team did four code releases so I was able to track the success of the changes and use that to inform decisions for the later releases.

Similar to the map page, the Location, Observation and Issues pages had a high bounce rate indicating users were not understanding the purpose of the page. On each of these pages are “cards” that have data in them (about either a Location, Observation or Issue depending on the page) however there was no context for how someone would effectively access the information on these pages. The team even indicated they had been actively trying to steer users away from them since they offered little value. The addition of a description and help popups was implemented successfully in a previous release (reduced the bounce rate by 10%) on the Group page (which had a similar format to the Location, Observation and Issues pages) so I decided to redesign the header of these pages to improve the usability of the pages and encourage users to stay on the app. First, I added a description of each page so that new users would understand the distinctions between each one. I also created a help pop-up that could be accessed from a link in the description to guide users in creating their own Location/Observation/Issue. Lastly, I added a search bar function so that users could search through the cards using various keywords (location name, country etc.).

"),Object(s["g"])("h2",null,"Key Takeaways"),Object(s["g"])("p",null," Ideally, when making design changes, you would be able to test and validate your designs on a test group of users before pushing to the main app. Due to the small team and limited financial resources, I was unable to directly test my designs on a group of users. User testing is often used in the UX industry to validate design changes but, again, due to the limitations of the project, I was unable to conduct controlled testing on the designs. Instead, I had to push the changes to the live site and then extrapolate their success based on the web analytics metrics mentioned in the Analysis section of this report. This means that the changes seen in the metrics could have been affected by factors other than the pure design change. However, I chose to validate the project based on metrics that would still provide a reliable indication of the success of the design changes. For example, instead of measuring the number of water testkit sales on the app as an indicator of successful new visitor visits I chose to measure the number of sign ups. The number of testkit sales could give a good idea of how effectively new users are converted but it could also be affected wildly by marketing. The number of new user signups on the other hand is more indicative of people who came to the site, had a good experience then signed up to return to the site and contribute to an increase in traffic.
