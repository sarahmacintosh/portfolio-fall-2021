Since spectrum is a limited natural resource -- two people can't broadcast on the same spectrum band in the same area or there will be interference -- the government needs to maintain accurate records of the licences in their system (SPECTRAplus). As part of my co-op I was tasked with documenting and improving the process for uploading ITU-BRIFIC data to SPECTRAplus. The ITU-BRIFIC is a document that contains all up-to-date international spectrum licencing data. Every two weeks - the ITU releases the BRIFIC document to its' stakeholders (e.g. governments and telecom providers). The standing process when I began this project only had the BRIFIC data being updated every 6 months (24 weeks) as it had to go through 3 different departments and 4 different teams multiple times before it was uploaded. This meant that the international data in the database was rarely up to date which could affect the validity of licences issued, especially those along the border.

After a couple iterations, the issues had been ironed out and I created a final task flow chart to map the process as well a document detailing the steps shown in the flow chart.
